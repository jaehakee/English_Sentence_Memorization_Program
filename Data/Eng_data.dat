I take it back.
I think so.
I’ll be in touch.
I’ll be there soon.
I’m not following.
I don’t get it
I gotta go.
I hear you.
I knew it.
I like your shoes.
Got it.
Something came up.
Sounds like a plan.
Ta-da.
Take your time.
Tell him I said hi.
Tell me about it.
Thank God.
That’s pretty much it.
That’s bullshit.
That’s random.
There you go.
Time’s up
Told ya.
Too bad.
Watch out.
We cool?
We’re almost there.
We’re on the same page.
What a small world.
What are you doing here?
My phone died.
Never mind.
No way!
No, I’m good.
Not necessarily.
Not really.
Not that I know of.
Same here.
Seriously?
Sleep tight.
It’s on me.
Jinx!
Just a second.
Just so you know…
Let it go.
Let me know.
Let me see.
Maybe another time.
Mazel tov.
My bad.
I’m on my way.
I’m working on it.
I’m done.
I’m home.
I’m off.
Is everything OK?
It happens.
It makes sense.
It’s not that big a deal.
It’s not my thing.
Hang in there.
Have a good one.
Have fun.
Hold on.
How are you holding up?
How come?
How did it go?
I appreciate it.
I didn’t mean it.
What do you say?
What’s going on?
What’s the matter?
Where were we?
Where you at?
Who knows?
Why bother?
Wish me luck.
You bet.
You’re the best.
